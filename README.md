# Google::API::Client
Provides client access for Google APIs via OAuth2

Examples are provided for local, programmatic access to several Google
products which require OAuth2 for access: Gmail and Google Contacts.
This module is different from Brian Duggan's module (see Credits below)
in that his uses a web server as the using project while this
module uses projects which are operated as programs on a local host.

Thanks to Brian Duggan and his ground-breaking work on using Google OAuth2 access
in his module [OAuth2::Client::Google](https://github.com/bduggan/p6-oauth2-client-google). 
In that module he lead the 
way for me through the sticky wicket of Google's description
of using its OAuth2.
